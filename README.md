Welcome to [NevarokML], the advanced plugin that brings the power of reinforcement learning to [Unreal Engine]. NevarokML
allows you to seamlessly train reinforcement learning models right from within the Unreal Engine environment
using [stable-baselines3].

With NevarokML, you have access to a wide range of supported algorithms, including PPO, A2C, DDPG, DQN, SAC, and TD3,
enabling you to choose the one that best suits your needs. The plugin also supports multi-agent training and
multi-environment training, offering flexibility and scalability in your machine-learning endeavors.

Train your models using NevarokML using either C++ or Blueprints, providing developers with the freedom to utilize their
preferred programming approach. Whether you're an experienced coder or a visual scripting enthusiast, NevarokML supports
you in creating intelligent systems within Unreal Engine.

After training your models, NevarokML allows you to import them into Unreal Engine
as [NNEModelData][NeuralNetworkEngine], seamlessly integrating them into your game or simulation. These trained models
can be deployed and shipped to platforms supported by Unreal's [Neural Network Engine (NNE)][NeuralNetworkEngine],
unlocking new possibilities for intelligent and immersive experiences.

NevarokML goes beyond gaming and simulation. It can be a powerful tool for solving game design issues and training
intelligent non-player characters (NPCs). Its applications are virtually limitless, opening doors to innovation and
creativity in various fields.

Explore the endless possibilities of machine learning in Unreal Engine with
NevarokML. [Start leveraging][getting-started] its capabilities today and unlock a new level of intelligent virtual
experiences.
